# Mathfreak231's PBR Mod

This mod is currently in a state of continuous development, do not expect it to work as advertised.

This mod contains features exclusive to Pok√©mon Battle Revolution, a Gen 4 spinoff for the Wii.
Although it is D/P based, PBR battles contain many features not found in the DS titles, such as an array of different battlefields, ties, and a built-in Sleep/Freeze clause.
This mod serves mostly to document these differences.

The mod also has a few features from [Twitch Plays Pokemon's](https://twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon) betting game of PBR, including locked switching and a rough emulation of its matchmaker.

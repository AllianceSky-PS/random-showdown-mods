# Mathfreak231's Random One-Offs

This particular mod folder isn't meant to be installed as a mod. Instead, it just contains random ideas that I just want to write down as a proof-of-concept.
If you want to use any of these in Pokemon Showdown, you'll have to copy-paste the code for them into your own mod.

In the case of `formats.js`, you'll copy-paste them into `config/formats.js`.
All formats in there are meant to be formats that can exist on their own without
any other modding.
